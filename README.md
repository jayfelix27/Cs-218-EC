Something interesting about me is that I really enjoy figuring out how computers work under the hood, especially in code. I like building projects that simulate real systems, like handling multiple threads at once or tracking and analyzing data over time.

Outside of that, I volunteer teaching kids how to code, which has been a fun challenge because it pushes me to explain technical ideas in simple, creative ways. It’s cool seeing someone go from not knowing what a loop is to building their own little game.
